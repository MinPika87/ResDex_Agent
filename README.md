## 🚀 Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
streamlit run resdx_agent/ui/streamlit_app.py
```
## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Using Docker
docker build -t resdx-agent .
docker run -p 8501:8501 resdx-agent
## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

# Using ADK deployment
python deployment/deploy.py --environment production

# Using cloud platforms
# See deployment/ directory for platform-specific configs
```

## 🔧 Extending the System

### Adding New Sub-Agents

1. **Create sub-agent structure:**
```bash
mkdir -p resdx_agent/sub_agents/your_agent
cd resdx_agent/sub_agents/your_agent
```

2. **Implement agent following ADK patterns:**
```python
# your_agent/agent.py
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.core.content import Content

class YourAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="YourAgent", tools=[...])

    async def execute(self, content: Content) -> Content:
        # Your agent logic here
        return Content(data={"success": True})
```

3. **Register with root agent:**
```python
# In resdx_agent/agent.py
if self.config.is_sub_agent_enabled("your_agent"):
    self.sub_agents["your_agent"] = YourAgent()
```

### Adding New Tools

```python
# resdx_agent/tools/your_tool.py
from google.adk.tools import Tool

class YourTool(Tool):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(name=name, description="Your tool description")

    async def __call__(self, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Tool implementation
        return {"success": True}
```
## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## 🤝 Contributing
## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make changes following ADK patterns
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Run the test suite: `poetry run pytest`
6. Submit a pull request
## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

### Development Guidelines
## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

- Follow Google ADK patterns for agent development
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Use type hints throughout the codebase
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Document all public APIs
## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## 📄 License
## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## 🆘 Support
## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

- **Documentation**: Check the `docs/` directory for detailed guides
- **Issues**: Report bugs via GitHub issues
- **Discussions**: Join our community discussions
- **Enterprise Support**: Contact the ResDex team
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
